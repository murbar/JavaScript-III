/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. implicit binding -> 'this' refers to the object left of the 'dot' 
* 2. explicit binding -> using the .call, .apply, or .bind methods to explicitly set context of 'this'
* 3. the 'new' keyword -> when invoked, new object is returned -- 'this' in constructor function is bound to that object
* 4. window binding -> when function is invoked without a 'dot' and not using .call, .apply, or .bind, 'this' will be bound to the window/global object -- "use strict" to prevent this undesirable behavior.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
